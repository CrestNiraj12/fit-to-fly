                        Some countries have imposed strict quarantine
                        regulations for anyone entering, typically requiring a
                        10-14 day isolation period. However, for some
                        destinations, that quarantine requirement can be waived
                        with a &lsquo;Fit to Fly Certificate&rsquo;. Airlines
                        and destinations require a certificate provided by a
                        company that has been accredited by UKAS. As such, they
                        will not accept results that are sent by text or email
                        and must instead have the original documents with the
                        laboratory report itself attached. Our pharmacies work
                        with UK Government approved renowned laboratories so cna

                        Please check with your destination to see if they are
                        accepting Fit to Fly COVID-19 Test Certificates, and to
                        determine how soon before departure the test has to be
                        undertaken. Some destinations require the test to take
                        place within 48 to 72 hours of travel, so the 24 hour
                        service being provided by the Pharmacy will be highly
                        beneficial to ensure that you get your results in time.
                        Please note that for COVID-19 Fit to Fly Travel Test
                        Certificates, the usual requirement is for a full PCR
                        swab test.

                        Test to Release is a COVID-19 testing scheme that has
                        been launched in the United Kingdom in order to shorten
                        the period of time required to quarantine.&nbsp;

                        Currently, the UK requires anyone entering the UK from
                        countries on the Amber List to quarantine at home for 10
                        days after arriving in the UK. However the Test to

                        December 2020, allows travellers returning to England to
                        pay privately for a COVID test five days after their
                        arrival - and provided the test is negative, complete

                        Destinations vary in when they would like you to have
                        your test. Some require it within 72 hours and others
                        within 96 hours, for example. You should confirm this
                        with your airline or relevant government website or
                        embassy. When you have this information, we can advise
                        you as to the best time to have your test with us to
                        ensure you receive your result at the right time.

                        The test is a PCR test meaning it can tell you if you
                        have an active coronavirus infection. It cannot tell you

                        clinicians will take your swab for you. This improves
                        accuracy and ensures sufficient samples are taken. Your
                        clinician will also verify your details to make sure
                        they match your passport. If you prefer to do it
                        yourself then, this option is also available. However,
                        we won&rsquo;t take any responsibility if your result
                        comes back &ldquo;Inconclusive&rdquo; or you make an
                        error while packing the swab samples. No refund will be

                        cannot however attend the pharmacy if you are
                        symptomatic or have recently had contact with someone
                        with confirmed COVID-19.
